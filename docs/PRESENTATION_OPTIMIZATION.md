## Key Talking Points Enhanced

### On Gamification (Slide 6)
"Users earn XP for every action—logging a meal, hitting nutrition targets, completing challenges. This isn't just for fun—it's backed by habit formation psychology. People are 80% more likely to stick with habits when tracking streaks."

### On Daily Challenges (Slide 6)
"We have 4 rotating daily challenges. Meal Logger wants you to log 3 meals. Protein Power helps you hit your protein goal. Hydration Hero connects to our water tracker. And Calorie Control keeps you under target. Each one rewards XP, and they reset daily to keep engagement high."

### On Streaks (Slide 10)
"Your current streak shows consecutive days of logging. Your longest streak is a personal record. We've learned that people are incredibly motivated NOT to lose a streak—psychological commitment is powerful. That's why we celebrate milestones: 3 days, 7 days, 30 days."

### On Water Tracking (Slide 11)
"We integrated water tracking because hydration affects everything—nutrient absorption, energy, focus. It's not just a feature; it connects to your daily challenges. The Hydration Hero challenge encourages consistency."
