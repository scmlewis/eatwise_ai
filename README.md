## 🎯 Portion Estimation System

The app includes an intelligent portion estimation system to help users understand nutrition accuracy:

| Level | Accuracy Range | Description | Example |
|-------|---|---|---|
| **SPECIFIC** | ±15% | Exact measurements given | "150g grilled chicken, 200g brown rice" |
| **GENERAL** | ±25% | Portion descriptors used | "chicken with rice and vegetables" |
| **MEDIUM-LOW** | ±30-35% | Vague but some details | "some chicken, rice, and broccoli" |
| **VAGUE** | ±40-50% | Minimal detail | "some chicken and rice" |

---

## 🤖 AI Capabilities

```python
# Meal analysis from text
analyzer = NutritionAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_text_meal("Grilled chicken with rice")
# → meal name, nutrition, healthiness score, health notes

# Image recognition
result = analyzer.analyze_food_image(image_bytes)
# → detected foods, nutrition, confidence

# Personalized recommendations
recommender = RecommendationEngine()
meals = recommender.get_personalized_recommendations(user_profile, meals)
# → 5 meal suggestions with reasons
```
